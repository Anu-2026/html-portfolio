 <h1>The Best movie according to Anu</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time </h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>Life of Pi</h3>
 <p>This movie is just on another level ,the music and the scene are so beautifully described.The young boy alone was alive after his whole family died when their ship sank in the ocean during thunderstorm .He was alone stuck with tiger in a rescue boat and later managed to survive.Not only the storyline is interesting also the ending was heartfelt when richard parker(tiger's name) not looked back at him and Irfan Khan explained an important life's secret.</p>
 <h3>Nil Battey Sannata</h3>
 <p>This movie gives purpose to life and motivates to keep on trying even if we fail.In this movie there is a young girl who is not good in her studies and her mother is a maid and do other jobs to make her study,she is a single mother.Her heart was broke when she heard from her daughter that she wants to become maid as well.Later she motivates her daughter to not only clear her boards but also make her to have a dream of her own. She said poor are not those who doesn't have money but those who donot have any dream to live on.The efforts of her mother so that her child doesnot end up like her is really commendable.</p>
 <h3>Soorma</h3>
 <p>This movie is recovery of oneself after a tradey happens to Sandeep Singh the hockey player know to be soorma.He was travelling  through a public transport when a bullet shot on his back while he was happy to be part of Indian hockey team . I just got goosebumps when he was not able stand and walk even then also he made himself strong enough , so as not only  he can  walk but become the one who he once was ,one and only Soorma. </p
